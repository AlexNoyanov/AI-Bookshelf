# AI-Bookshelf
Put your books here and chat with AI about it

# Main goal
While we don't usaly have a privelege of having a free time to read to the book we want I came up with this simple solution.
Just put your books on AI Bookshelf and ask all the questions about them! 
It will help you save a lot of time and give all the answers. 

# How to use?
Simple: 
1) Go to @ai_bookshelf_bot in Telegram and hit /start
2) Send all the books you need answers from in PDF
3) Start chatting with /question (Dev in progress... You can help too!)
